FlameBird Info

FB2 is an opensource integrated development environment for Fenix,
which  is free  opensource  compiler for a  language  derived from
"DIV  Games  Studio". More information about Fenix can be found at 
the  official  website.  FB2 is being  written  in Visual Basic 6. 

FB2's  is  the continuation of the popular IDE for Fenix Firebird,
developed   by  JaViS.  Our  aim  is  to  create  a  proffessional
environment,    avoiding    the   bugs   of   previous   versions.

FB2  provides  many  tools  to  simplify  development  with Fenix, 
some  of  the  features  it has are: A powerfull text editor, with 
syntax   highlighting   ,   code   completion  (intellisense  like 
technology  which can be found in Microsoft VC++ or VB), code tips
(which  help  you  to  remember  the  parameters to be passed to a 
function),  and  any  other  characteristics  editors  should have 
(searching  tools,  bookmarks,  etc).  Although  FB2 can work with 
individual   files,   it  supports  creation  of  projects,  which 
helps  you  to  keep  your  files  organized.  You can browse your
project  files  through  the Project Browser. Working with a great 
amount of code lines is no longer a problem since FB2 incorporates
a  useful  tool  to  keep  a record of all the variables, process,
constants,  etc.,  and  not  only of the file you are working with 
but  also of all the project files. Sometimes we need to work with 
different  versions  of  Fenix  for different projects. FB2 allows
you  to  configure  the compiler you want to use for each of them, 
saving  you  from  having  to change it continuously. We have been 
careful   to   distinguish   local  configuration  from  non-local 
configuration  in  a  project file, allowing you to share your FB2
project  file  with  other developers without coming into conflict
with  their  configuration. This is very useful when a project has 
more  than  one  developer. When managing a project, keeping track 
of issues, requests and other data can be a bit thorny. FB2 allows
you  to  define  trackers,  which  will  help  you  to  store this 
information  in  the  project  file.  Visualize your Maps, Now you 
can  open  8-bit  and  16-bit  map files easily (the map editor is 
in  an early version though). Plug-in support; You can create your
own  plug-ins  for  FB2  or  use  the  ones which were created for 
Firebird 0.8.  This makes FB2 a highly customizable IDE.Many other
features,  which  you  will  discover  meanwhile  you  are working 
with FB2... 

FB2  is  still  in  a  beta version and so there are many features 
that   haven't   been   added   yet   such   Fenix  Files  editors 
(pal,  fpg,  maps,  fbm...).  At  last,  we  would  like to have a 
complete  environment  for  fenix  that  combines  simplicity with
productivity.
